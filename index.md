I am Wei Zhang, currently a R&D engineer at Microsoft Azure since July 2018 (operating system, distributed system, next generation network, edge computing).

From Sep 2008 to Dec 2014, I was a Phd student in computer science at Beihang University advised by by [Prof. Mingfa Zhu](http://www.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/node/160). Meanwhile, I was also a visitng student at Institute of Computing Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences (June 2010 to July 2012) and at the George Washington University (Nov 2012 to Oct 14). I had my second phd life from Jan 15 to Aug 18 advised by [Prof. Timothy Wood](http://faculty.cs.gwu.edu/~timwood/wiki/doku.php).
